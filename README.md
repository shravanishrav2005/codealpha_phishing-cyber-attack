## TASK-2  Phishing Awareness Training

Create a presentation or online training module about
phishing attacks. Educate others about recognizing and
avoiding phishing emails, websites, and social
engineering tactics



## How does phishing work? 
Phishing works by luring a victim with legitimate-looking (but fraudulent) emails or other communication from a trusted (or sometimes seemingly desperate) sender who coaxes victims into providing confidential informationâ€”often on what looks to be a convincingly legitimate website. Sometimes malware or ransomware is also downloaded onto the victim's computer. 

Phishers frequently use tactics like fear, curiosity, a sense of urgency, and greed to compel recipients to open attachments or click on links.
Phishing attacks are designed to appear to come from legitimate companies and individuals.
Cybercriminals are continuously innovating and using increasingly sophisticated techniques, including spear phishing (an attack directed at a specific person or group) and other strategies, to trick users into clicking or tapping.
It only takes one successful phishing attack to compromise your network and steal your data, which is why it is always important to Think Before You Click. (You can click that link, as it has important phishing stats and information.)
Who are the targets of phishing?
Anyone. Most phishing attacks target numerous email addresses with the hope that some percentage of users will be tricked. Security-awareness training is helpful in educating users on the dangers of phishing attacks and teaches strategies to identify phishing communications. 

## Why are phishing attacks so effective? 
Phishing is effective because it exploits the vulnerabilities of human nature, including a tendency to trust others, act out of curiosity, or respond emotionally to urgent messages. And phishing attacks are increasingly easy to perpetrate with phishing kits readily available on the dark web. It's a relatively low-risk pursuit for attackers, with bulk email addresses easy to obtain and emails virtually free to send.

## Phishing is evolving with AI
The first primitive forms of phishing attacks emerged decades ago in chat rooms. Since then, phishing has evolved in complexity to become one of the largest and most costly cybercrimes on the internet that leads to business email compromise (BEC), (email account takeover (ATO), and ransomware. More recently, AI has made it easier for attackers to carry out sophisticated and targeted attacks by correcting spelling mistakes and personalizing messaging. For example, cybercriminals collect identifying information on groups or individuals they want to target and then use that information to mount highly personalized phishing campaigns called spear phishing. Because spear phishing communications are much more personalized, they can look especially legitimate, and thus are even more dangerous. 

On the other hand, AI security solutions are enabling advanced detection and prevention techniques. Now Cisco Secure products leverage predictive and generative AI that expands our reach and interaction with security touchpoints. Cisco Secure Email Threat Defense uses unique artificial intelligence and machine learning models, including natural language processing (NLP), to identify malicious techniques used in attacks targeting your organization, derive unparalleled context for specific business risks, provide searchable threat telemetry, and categorize threats to understand which parts of your organization are most vulnerable to attack.
